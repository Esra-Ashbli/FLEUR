Pain points:
1. Time: working people are too busy to go about local flower store or market looking for the best flower to buy.
2. Variety: users want to have variety of flowers to choose from for different occasions, but sometime gets disappointed.
3. Delivery: sometimes on time delivery option is not available.
4. Quality: sometime people do not get good quality flowers, and the flowers they want are not available.
5. Other apps: apps are mainly focusing on flower as a gift.

### Define & ideate
After discovering and searching steps we can imagine the user journey from beginning to end. Which starts from need of the product and ends at getting it. This path is mapped by user’s action, tasks wich he carry out to get the product wich leads to pain points.

* So this journey stats with user goale.
* Actions: search, explore, choosing a product, place order, payment, receiving the order.

After knowing the user journey, we want to make it easier and we want to get the user expectations about our new app. So there is some improvement points we will ably it on our application.

* Create a mobile app where user can get everything at one platform.
* Making sure variety is there with customization option.
* Making ui more easy & simple.
* Offers can be included .
* Flexible delivery option can be provided.


We have analysed other online flower shopping app. Studied customers reviews and expectation. Checked what other apps have and what they don’t. and got some good points in them. So we are going to use them in our app and adding some extra features and options.

These features are:
1. Rating
