**Pain points:**

2. Variety: users want to have variety of flowers to choose from for different occasions, but sometime gets disappointed.
3. Delivery: sometimes on time delivery option is not available.
4. Quality: sometime people do not get good quality flowers, and the flowers they want are not available.
5. Other apps: apps are mainly focusing on flower as a gift.

### Define & ideate
After discovering and searching steps we can imagine the user journey from beginning to end. Which starts from need of the product and ends at getting it. This path is mapped by user’s action, tasks wich he carry out to get the product wich leads to pain points.

* So this journey stats with user goale.
* Actions: search, explore, choosing a product, place order, payment, receiving the order.

After knowing the user journey, we want to make it easier and we want to get the user expectations about our new app. So there is some improvement points we will ably it on our application.

### Testing (usability testing)
After working on app screens, we give it to users to see it. We asked them if they understand the work of the application easily. And if this is all a user wants & needs or do we need to make some changes to fulfill our users expectations and make this application more efficient.
